Curtis Kieser: <FILL IN LATER>

Chris Bilger: We worked physically side-by-side for the majority of this project. I personally wrote the code for the bullet line items 1,3,4,5, and 7. I have the commit history for line item number 8; however, Curtis wrote that on my laptop. I don't like this showing up this way, so for all future projects I will only commit what I personally wrote. I contributed code, but in my opinion, more ideas than anything. I think that I found fairly simplistic ways of approaching each test case so that the tests would pass and that they would correctly test for each bullet item. I learned that communication is necessary when working on programs because it is very easy to work on the same part at the same time and it's also very easy to forget to merge newly updated repository code into your local code before adding a new feature.
